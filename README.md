//*************** ARCHAIC ***************//

Welcome to Archaic, an interpreted, dynamically-typed coding language!
If Merlin wanted to code, what language would he use? 
If Solaire of Astora had to take a course on data structures what language would he be 
comfortable with? 

ARCHAIC!

Syntatically, Archaic reads like medieval prose.

For example:

A while loop is a whilst loop in Archaic!

Some example source code can be found below:

    Forge anew a variable known as VARIABLE
    Let VARIABLE be ascribed the value of 5
    
    Whilst VARIABLE is of meager value compared to 10
    Should VARIABLE be of meager value compared to 7
    Exclaim unto the world "Less than 7"
    Thus concludes this statement
    Exclaim unto the world VARIABLE
    Embolden VARIABLE with 1
    Thus concludes this statement
