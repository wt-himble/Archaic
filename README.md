//*************** ARCHAIC ***************//

Welcome to Archaic, an interpreted, dynamically-typed coding language!
If Merlin wanted to code, what language would he use? 
If Solaire of Astora had to take a course on data structures what language would he be 
comfortable with? 

ARCHAIC!

Syntatically, Archaic reads like medieval prose.

For example:

A while loop is a whilst loop in Archaic!

Some example source code can be found below:

    Exclaim unto the world "This is the start of the code"

    Forge anew a variable known as X
    Let X be ascribed the value of 0

    Whilst X is of meager value compared to 10

    Exclaim unto the world X

    Should X be of equal value compared to 7
    Exclaim unto the world "This is how a conditional works"
    Thus concludes this statement

    Embolden X with 1

    Thus concludes this statement

Here is the output:

    OUT: This is the start of the code
    OUT: 0
    OUT: 1.000000
    OUT: 2.000000
    OUT: 3.000000
    OUT: 4.000000
    OUT: 5.000000
    OUT: 6.000000
    OUT: 7.000000
    OUT: This is how a conditional works
    OUT: 8.000000
    OUT: 9.000000
